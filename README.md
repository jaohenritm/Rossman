Rossmann is one of Europe's largest drugstore chains. With around 56,200 employees and over 4,000 stores. In 2019, Rossmann had sales of over â‚¬10 billion with majority of that sales on Germany. With such a large number and variety of stores, it is very important that the management of the company have a base of sales in the future, with this a business issue has arisen that the company's CFO needs to resolve at the moment.

## 1.1 Problem Context
The Rossmann CFO needs to do some renovations on their stores and requested for all managers to give him some kind of sales forecast for the next 6 weeks. With that forecast he will know how much he will be allowed to invest in that renevues. As the managers don't have the tools needed to do that forecast, they asked the Data Team to develop a solution for their business problem.
